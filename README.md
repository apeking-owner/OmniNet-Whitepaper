🌐 What Is OmniNet?

OmniNet replaces today’s centralized, siloed, surveillance-driven Web2/Web3 systems with a unified, privacy-first, AI-native internet layer engineered for:

AI-native personal computing

Autonomous agents & distributed intelligence

Holographic & AR user interfaces

Semantic data models

Multi-device ecosystems

Local + global mesh networking

User-owned identity & trust

OmniNet is not a blockchain, not a cloud service, and not a traditional OS.
It is a new internet layer purpose-built for the next era of computing.

🧬 OmniNet Architecture (Full Stack)

OmniNet introduces a layered architecture spanning identity, data, intelligence, networking, compute, and UI.

🔐 1. OmniID — Universal Identity Layer

Self-sovereign, cryptographically secured personal identity.

🧱 2. OmniVault — Encrypted Personal Data Layer

User-owned memory, storage, and private compute.

🕸 3. OmniGraph — Semantic Knowledge Graph

A unified real-time graph representing your identity, devices, knowledge, relationships, and AI agents.

🕶 4. OmniUI — Holographic & AR Operating Layer

Multi-modal, holographic, spatial computing environment.

🔄 5. OmniSync — Real-Time Sync Layer

Atomic, lossless, delta-based synchronization across all devices.

📡 6. OmniMesh — Device-to-Device Mesh Networking

Resilient, local and global mesh routing for offline + hybrid connectivity.

🌐 7. OmniProtocol — New Communication Protocol

A graph-native, intelligence-aware protocol beyond TCP/IP and HTTP.

⚙️ 8. HyperStructures — Distributed Compute Layer

Self-balancing compute across devices, mesh nodes, and global networks.

🛰 9. PrimeNet — Global Routing Architecture

A routing layer for identities, knowledge, sessions, and agents — not just packets.

💠 10. OmniEconomy — Trust-Based Value System

A cryptographic trust and reputation layer without tokens or blockchain.

🧩 11. OmniNet SDK — Developer Framework

Tools for building graph-native, identity-native, AI-native applications.

🧠 Research Positioning

OmniNet contributes to multiple frontier research domains:

AI-native internet architecture

Internet of Agents (IoA)

Post-TCP/IP protocol design

Semantic identity & data layers

Distributed intelligence networks

Holographic operating systems

Graph-native compute & routing

Ambient computing ecosystems

These fields are active at Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Microsoft Research, Meta, Apple, Nvidia, and top universities.

🆚 Why OmniNet Is Different
Compared to Web2

✔ No data silos
✔ No platform lock-in
✔ User owns their identity

Compared to Web3 / Blockchain

✔ No tokens or mining
✔ No global consensus latency
✔ Identity-based trust (not economic-based)

Compared to IPFS

✔ Identity-aware
✔ Stateful sync
✔ Graph-native

Compared to Traditional Operating Systems

✔ Network-first
✔ Holographic-native
✔ AI as a core subsystem
