🌐 What Is OmniNet?

OmniNet introduces a new internet architecture designed for the age of AI, AR, holographic interfaces, distributed intelligence, and multi-device computing.

It replaces today’s centralized, surveillance-driven, siloed web with a unified, privacy-first, intelligence-native layer built on:

🔑 Core Components
• OmniID — Universal Identity Layer

Decentralized, cryptographically secure personal identity.

• OmniVault — Encrypted Personal Data Core

Private memory storage with user-controlled access.

• OmniGraph — Semantic Knowledge Graph

Your data, memories, devices, and AI agents represented as a unified graph.

• OmniUI — Holographic Multi-Modal Interface

AR/holographic user interface for next-generation computing.

• OmniSync — Universal Sync Layer

Real-time sync across all devices, apps, and environments.

• OmniMesh — Device-to-Device Mesh Network

Local and global mesh networking for resilient communication.

• OmniProtocol — New Communication Protocol

An intelligent, graph-native alternative to legacy TCP/IP interactions.

• HyperStructures — Distributed Compute Layer

Self-optimizing compute architecture across personal and global networks.

• PrimeNet — Global Routing Layer

Next-generation routing for identity, knowledge, and intelligent agents.

• OmniEconomy — Trust-Based Value System

A new model for digital value, trust scoring, and personal data exchange.

• OmniNet SDK — Developer Framework

Tools for building graph-native, identity-native, AI-native apps.

🚫 What OmniNet Is Not

OmniNet is not:

Not a blockchain

Not a cloud service

Not a traditional OS

Not Web2 or Web3

Not a centralized platform

OmniNet is a new internet layer — designed from the ground up for:

AI-native computing

Augmented & holographic interfaces

Global personal intelligence networks

User sovereignty & privacy
